            <div>
              <p>Unlike the usual vacation, space travel requires months of intense preperation and dedication so that
                the vacationer can enjoy it to the highest extent. Our greatest concern is our customer's endurance, so,
                we always recommend them to start training no less than 10 months in advance, especially if they plan to
                go past the Earth's atmosphere and onto the Moon's surface.</p>
            </div>
            <div><img class="imgs_safety" src="WebsitePhotos/whitegym.jpg" /></div>

            <div><img class="imgs_safety" src="WebsitePhotos/diet.jpg" /></div>
            <div>
              <p>During the training period, customers are given access to our private gym without additional charges.
                They are also provided with an all expense paid cabin at the base of Mount Rainier where costumers are
                encouraged to fight with the high altitude so that you can build up the muscle and lung strength you
                will need for this trip. These places, and more, are where costumers can train themselves physically
                specifically for endurance and stamina. We also require our customers to know some emergency procedures
                just in case the Sun decides to cut off our communication for a bit. We provide a diet plan, however we
                mostly recommend it for those who have high blood pressure, as this can cause worsened hypertension and
                in some cases, heart problems such as microvascular disease. We guarentee all of our support and
                strength to ensure that these extreme cases never see the light of day within, or after, your trip, but
                you will have to work with us as this is more like a partnership than split responsibility.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>Now this goes without saying, but if you do not prepare properly, you will not be able to go into the
                awaiting universe. Of course, you will get some money back (not a full refund because of training
                amenities) if you cancel. 2 months before we embark on this trip together, there will be world class
                physicians to check your health, physical, and mental status. If you are not cleared, this trip is a
                no-go. If this happens to occur, you, the costumer, will have the choice of rescheduling the flight for
                a later date, or canceling.</p>
            </div>
            <div><img class="imgs_safety" src="WebsitePhotos/mountain.jpeg" /></div>
          </div>

          <p>Now, we do have our own space suits, but as we are an emerging company, we understand a customer's
            hesitation to use them. However, we still do offer the choice for customers if they would like to use our
            spacesuits, or a different company's. Our space wear is crafted from nylon, spandex, and essential liquid
            cooling tubes to ensure our customer's safety and comfort.</p>
